During my internship at eSpark Consulting Group, a software house company in Karachi, Paksitan, I worked on FlexMold a project which was developed and designed using .NET Framework and C# language. The system controls and monitors weather conditions such as humidity, temperature using motors. I developed a window UI using C# and XAML language which saves the updated setting of weather conditions  in SQLITE database. Smart Masjid App is mobile application which was developed using React Native framework and JavaScript language. I ran the application, analyzed the frontend as well as the coding, API, backend, controllers, and I am trying to further understand the app.
