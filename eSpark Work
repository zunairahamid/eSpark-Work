The system controls and monitors weather conditions such as humidity, temperature using motors. I developed a UI which saves the updated setting of weaher conditions in SQLITE database. Smart Masjid App is mobile application which was developed using React Native framework and JavaScript language. I ran the application, analyzed the frontend as well as the coding.
